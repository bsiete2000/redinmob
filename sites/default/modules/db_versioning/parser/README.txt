This module uses a parser to do the transformation from SQL to a PHP understandable
structure. By now, we use php-sql-parser (http://code.google.com/p/php-sql-parser/)
In the future, better parsers could be used, but the main goal in this, is to use
the Mysql parser itself (by now didn't try to make any attempt to implement this 
way, due to lack of time)
